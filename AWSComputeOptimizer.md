#### Result Classifications


9\. **Classifications**

**Compute Optimizer categorizes findings into four main classifications:**

### 1. Under Provisioned

- **Definition**: At least one specification (CPU, memory, or network) does not meet the performance requirements.
- **Impact**: This can result in poor performance.

### 2. Over Provisioned

- **Definition**: At least one specification (CPU, memory, or network) can be reduced in size while still meeting performance requirements.
- **Criteria**: This classification is only applied if *no specification* is under provisioned.
- **Impact**: May result in unnecessary costs.

### 3. Optimized

- **Definition**: All specifications (CPU, memory, and network) meet the workload's performance requirements and are not over provisioned.

### 4. None

- **Definition**: No recommendations are available.
- **Possible Reasons**:
  - The service was opted into for 12 hours or less.
  - The instance has been running for less than 30 hours.
  - The instance type is not supported by Compute Optimizer.


#### Reviewing Recommendations


10\. **Recommendations for EC2 Instances**

This page provides a list of your current EC2 instances with the top recommendation options generated by Compute Optimizer.

This demo shows no recommendations. Recall this could be due to any of the following:

- The service was opted into for 12 hours or less.

21\. **When evaluating EC2 instance recommendations, follow this structured approach to ensure optimal performance and cost efficiency:**

### Data Analysis

- **Historical Data Review**:
  - Recommendations are generated based on the analysis of data from the past 14 days.
  - Note: These recommendations do not account for future needs or anticipated changes.
- **Metric Evaluation**:
  - Examine graphed metrics to determine if actual usage is consistently lower than the instance's capacity.
  - Utilize CloudWatch to view detailed metrics such as average, peak, and percentiles. Assess whether CPU usage varies throughout the day and if peak times need accommodation.

### Burstable Performance Instances

- **Definition**: Burstable performance instances are EC2 instances that provide a baseline level of CPU performance with the ability to burst above the baseline when needed. They are designed to handle occasional spikes in load.
- For instances with burstable performance capabilities:
  - If the instance periodically exceeds its baseline performance, ensure that it can continue to do so with the virtual CPUs (vCPUs) of any new instance type you consider.

### Cost and Compatibility Considerations

- **Reserved Instances**:
  - Analyze the impact on any Reserved Instance options you might be using before committing to changes.
- **Instance Generation and Compatibility**:
  - Whenever possible, consider upgrading to newer instance generations to enhance performance and efficiency.
  - When migrating to a different instance family, ensure compatibility in virtualization, architecture, and network configurations between the current and new instance types.

### Risk Assessment and Testing

- **Risk Rating**:
  - Review the risk rating provided with each recommendation. This indicates the level of effort required to validate the recommendations properly.
- **Testing**:
  - Conduct load and performance testing both before and after implementing any changes to verify improvements and avoid potential issues.

By adhering to these guidelines, you can make informed decisions that align with your performance goals and budgetary constraints.
